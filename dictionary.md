# Terms & Definitions
- **Asset** - A visual / audio / data element that comprises an experience. Usually can be separated into an individual file. <br>
    <sub>Ex: 3D model, image / texture, sound effect, material, text file, etc.</sub>
- **External Asset** - An asset that would need to be created with external tools.
- **External Tool** - A secondary app on the headset or a computer program that may be used to create brand new assets.
  The Meta Quest Browser, Discord, or any other application for the purpose of downloading assets will not be considered an external tool.
- **Instance**
    - An instruction to duplicate a specific prefab and parent it to one or more other objects. <br>
        <sub>Ex: Creating an instance is how you put the asset into the environment.</sub>
    - The duplicated prefab itself. <br>
        <sub>Ex: The instance will just sit there until its parent moves.</sub>
    - To make a new instance. <br>
        <sub>Ex: The flower needs to be instanced onto the field.</sub>
- **Internal Asset** - An asset that would need to be created in Flair or Unity.
- **Prefab** - A Unity `GameObject` with all children, components, and assets grouped together into one *thing* that is ready to be placed down somewhere.
- **Project** - A self contained collection of related assets and instances. They are stored as `.flair` files and can be shared among people. <br>
    <sub>Ex: An asset pack containing different shapes. A small project that simply puts an XYZ axis on the controller. A large project that completely transforms the menu environment into a different game.</sub>
- **Remix** - When someone downloads another person's project, copies their assets, and changes them in some way. <br>
    <sub>Ex: You download a field environment and think one of the flowers look pretty. You then make a new project that places the flower on your saber rather than on the field.</sub>
